# 🚨 **Postmortem: Bank Fee Transparency Tool Outage**  

## 🛑 **Issue Summary**  
- **📅 Duration:** February 25, 2025, 14:10 - 16:45 WAT (2 hours, 35 minutes)  
- **💥 Impact:**  
  - **100% downtime** – Users could not access the platform.  
  - Users encountered **`500 Internal Server Error`** on all pages.  
- **🔍 Root Cause:**  
  - Misconfigured **PostgreSQL connection pool**, leading to database connection exhaustion and backend failure.  

## 📜 **Timeline**  

| Time (WAT) | Event |
|------------|--------|
| **14:10** | System monitoring alerts triggered (high database connection usage). |
| **14:15** | User complaints received via support. |
| **14:25** | Engineers investigate logs, suspecting backend issue. |
| **14:40** | Backend services restarted; issue persists. |
| **14:55** | PostgreSQL logs reveal connection pool exhaustion. |
| **15:10** | Initial assumption: high traffic spike. |
| **15:30** | Query analysis shows **no unusual traffic**. |
| **15:50** | Root cause identified: **unclosed database connections**. |
| **16:10** | Fixed connection pool settings, redeployed backend. |
| **16:45** | System fully restored and monitored for stability. |

## ⚙️ **Root Cause and Fix**  

### 🔎 **Root Cause**  
- The Node.js backend used `pg-pool`, but **database connections were not properly released**.  
- As a result, PostgreSQL reached its **maximum connection limit**, blocking new queries.  

### 🛠️ **Resolution**  
✅ Adjusted **connection pooling settings** to close idle connections.  
✅ Implemented **timeouts** for stale connections.  
✅ Redeployed backend with **new database configurations**.  

## 🚀 **Preventative Measures**  

### 💡 **Improvements Needed**  
- Improve **database connection management** to prevent exhaustion.  
- Strengthen **monitoring alerts** for early connection leak detection.  
- Add **failover mechanisms** to handle database failures gracefully.  

### ✅ **Action Items (TODO)**  
- [ ] **Patch connection pooling logic** to release unused connections.  
- [ ] **Add monitoring alerts** for high database connection usage.  
- [ ] **Implement request throttling** to prevent excessive DB connections.  
- [ ] **Run load tests** to simulate high traffic and validate fixes.
